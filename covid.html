                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people around the world have had to get tested. 
                    After a possible exposure in my family, I struggled to find a testing center near me.
                    I realized that if a technological 20-year-old was having trouble, 
                    others would too.</p>

                    <p>Find My COVID Test improves the accessibility of finding a COVID-19 testing center 
                        in California by allowing patients to filter testing locations based on their preferences for distance, insurance coverage, 
                        testing method, fee, and doctor's referral. </p>
                </div>                
            </section>


            <!-- Research -->
            <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-mirror="true" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center" data-aos-offset="-200">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>To learn more about other people’s experience registering for a 
                    COVID-19 testing center, I conducted an online research study surveying 39 past COVID-19 testing patients. 
                    From this survey, I found that on average it took users approximately 15 minutes to find a testing center and
                     register for an appointment.</p>

                    <p>
                    Additionally, the most difficult parts of the process were:
                    <ol>
                        <li>finding the testing registration website</li>
                        <li>finding a nearby testing center</li>
                        <li>needing a doctor’s referral</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Using this information, I came up with the research question:</p>
                    <p class = "callout">
                        "How might I reduce friction of finding a COVID-19 test for a 
                        diverse crowd of people (age, insurance status, income, etc.)?"
                    </p>

                    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website</a>, 
                    I found that adults of any age with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, COPD, obesity, 
                    liver disease, or smoke have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. For these reasons, my target audience was:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age: 30-50 Years old</li>
                        <li>Gender: Male/Female</li>

                        <p>Through my first prototype, I had acknowledged all of the user’s highest requests, 
                        allowing them to schedule and register for a COVID-19 testing appointment within seconds. 
                        I created a simple and easy-to-use user interface that would satisfy my target audience because of 
                        its simplicity, multi-step process, and large signifying buttons/symbols.</p>

            <!-- ADD HEADER ABOUT CHANGE - TRANSITIONING INTO DEVELOPMENT -->

                <p>I began to think of ways to develop this prototype into a real application. However, the only way to register a user 
                to an appointment would require my application to have access to every COVID-19 testing center’s registration database. 
                I knew this would be highly unlikely. </p>
    
                <p>Considering my critical users are less technically adept and would have a hard time seeing smaller screens, I knew that
                    a desktop version would be more suitable.
                    However, a mobile version would be better for younger people who primarily access the internet through their mobile phones.  
                    Using my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I knew that I needed to turn this into a real life responsive website
                    that would be able to meet the needs of <b>all potential users</b>.</p>

                        Given more screen real estate, I came up with the idea to have a filtering menu on the left side of the page to allow users to quickly and easily 
                        find a COVID testing center that met their personal needs.

                    <p>Going into Figma, I made some changes from my sketches, adding a menu on the left that would show a list of COVID testing locations with 
                        the location name, address, and criteria necessary for an appointment. Ultimately, I ruled against this design as it was too complicated and 
                        made the application confusing.</p>

                        I eliminated the list view. Additionally, to solve the problem of 
                        not being able to register patients directly, my solution was to 
                        have a button that would open the webpage for users to register for 
                        their COVID-19 test on a new page.</p>

                        <p>After compiling a list of testing centers in California, I omitted the filtering option of Appointment because
                        every testing center required an appointment. Additionally, I added a search bar feature that

                    <p>I received a lot of constructive feedback that helped polish and push Find My COVID Test to its final version. 
                    
                    For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cost was rewritten to Fee and Test Type to Test Method. </li>
                        <li>On page load, the filter buttons would be selected to Any, to clearly illustrate that no filters were applied</li>
                        <li>Zoom-in and zoom-out buttons on the map for both mobile and desktop users. </li>
                        <li>Testing center address would be clickable, linking the user directly to Google Maps where 
                        they’d be able to find out how far a testing center was from their current location</li>

                        stored coordinates to the map interface.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>At the start of the pandemic, finding a COVID test was a difficult challenge. 
                        </p>
                        
                    <p class = "callout">Since the release of Find My COVID Test, I have been able to help <b>more than 3,000 people</b> find COVID-19 tests with an 
                        <b>average time of 34 seconds</b>.</p> 
            
                    <p>Prior to creating this website, past test recipients reported that the average time test was <b>15 minutes</b>. 
                        Overall, my website has greatly reduced the search time for finding the most suitable COVID-19 test. 
                        With the improved accessibility, I hope to be able to increase the amount of California residents receiving tests, 
                        creating a healthier and aware community that can flatten the curve.</p>
            
                      <p>As I continue to add testing locations to the map, I am proactively reaching out to the California government and testing organizations such as Verily- Project Baseline, CVS Health, and Walgreens to work together and improve the website's map coverage across the United States.</p>
            
                      <p>Being the sole designer and developer of this project has been rewarding in itself to positively impact the community and make finding COVID testing more accessible to the public.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>After many sleepless nights and 6 weeks later, I am so proud to release Find My COVID Test to the public.
                        This was definitely the most challenging design and development project that I have ever worked on.
                        It was a HUGE learning experience for myself and taught me much more than I could have ever imagined. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The biggest challenge I had while creating this website was imposter syndrome. There were many times
                        where I had encountered significant development problems. However, I was determined to develop the 
                        website no matter what as I knew the true potential and how big of a difference I could create in 
                        the world once it was released.

                    Verily- Project Baseline</a> and <a href = "https://curative.com/">Curative</a>. With their help,
                    Find My COVID Test now has <b>over 1,100 testing locations</b> to choose from!</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I was featured in an <a href = "https://lettersandscience.ucdavis.edu/blog/design-students-interactive-map-links-public-covid-19-testing-sites">article</a> by the University of California, Davis Letters and Sciences
