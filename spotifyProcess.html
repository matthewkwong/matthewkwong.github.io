        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          As an avid Spotify user, I noticed a problem that effected my music listening experience when driving with friends. 
          In most cases, there's passengers arguing for the aux cord,
          who gets to queue music, and terrible song selection. 
          As the driver, this can be extremely distracting and unsafe.</p>

        <p>How can I improve the music listening experience when in group settings?</p>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>After thinking about the main problem to this terrible music listening
          experience, I concluded that the problem was that only one person's music
          taste was being played.</p>

        <p>To solve this problem, I decided to make a prototype feature I would want introduced into the Spotify
          mobile application called Rooms. Rooms would allow Spotify users to collaboratively 
          listen to music together with the abilities to add and vote to remove songs in listening parties.
        </p>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>While creating the design of this new feature,
          it was important that the aesthetic was clean and simple while still
          being able to meet all core features. Through this process I kept in mind
          that often the best applications require the least amount of steps to use.
          Additionally, I chose to use Spotify as the main platform as it's my
          favorite music streaming service and the most popular amongst my friends.

            <p>By introducing a vote kicking functionality, unwanted songs will be removed with a 2/3 majority vote.

              listening experience great for all passengers</p>

        <h2 >Challenges</h2>
        <p>Building an entire user interface and experience by yourself is
          challenging. Some design challenges I faced include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I create the easiest way for users to join a Room?</li>
          <li>How can the Rooms feature be safe for drivers?</li>
          <li>How can I reach out and promote my product?</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Takeaways / Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project was super motivating for me to increase my skills
          as a designer and to learn more about the UI/UX field. This was my first
          ever project focussing on the user interface and experience flow of an application.
          I am very happy with the work that I put in to this project and the solution I came up
          with to create a new way to share music at group events.</p>

        <h2>Responses + Moving Forward:</h2>
        <p>After building this project, I built an <a href="https://www.matthewkwong.com/spotify-rooms/">advertisement
            website</a> showcasing and selling the idea.
          Using this site, I reached out to 300+ Product Designers and
          Product Managers at Spotify for feedback and to potentially receive an internship the
          upcoming summer. Working at Spotify has been a dream
          of mine since 2015 as a sophomore in high school. As weeks passed, I soon received
          feedback from the Spotify employees I had asked for feedback from.
        </p>

        <p>
          In October 2019, I drove 2 hours to attend a Spotify internship recruitment panel
          at the University of California, Berkeley. I had the opportunity to present and
          demo my project with product managers at the company and pitch my idea and
          prototype. This was a great learning experience and was a lot of fun getting feedback
          and learning more about the company.
        </p>

        <p>Sadly, I did not receive a Product Design internship at Spotify, but hope to continue applying
          for internship and full time positions in Fall 2020.</p>

        <p>On May 11, 2020, the feature was released in beta according to
          <a
            href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254426/spotify-group-sessions-feature-update-beta-premium-subscription">
            The Verge</a>. I was able to try it out and it was awesome to see that the feature was similar to what I had
          imagined. It was so awesome to see that the feature I had envisioned was released and that
          I was on the right thinking path as the Spotify team.
