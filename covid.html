                    After a possible exposure in my family, it was unsure if we had been in contact with someone with COVID-19. After struggling 
                    to find a testing center near me, I realized that if a 20-year-old is having trouble, others would too.</p>

                    <p>To learn more about other people’s experience registering for a 
                    COVID-19 testing center, I conducted an online research study surveying 39 past COVID-19 testing patients. 
                    From this survey, I found that on average it took users approximately 16 minutes to find a testing center and
                     register for an appointment.</p>

                    <p class = "callout">
                    Additionally, the most difficult part of the process was finding the testing registration website, 
                    finding a nearby testing center, and needing a doctor’s referral. </p>

                    liver disease, or smoke have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. For these reasons, my target audience was:</p>

                    <p>Using my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I knew that I needed to turn this into a real life website, but would need to rethink

                         was a familiar icon that users would recognize.

                    <p>Along with designing Find My COVID Test, I also developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p> 
                    
                    <p>This required me to also learn how to use Google Firebase Database to store the testing location data 
                        along with the Google Maps API to access the location database and plot the map pins using the
                        stored coordinates to the map interface.</p>

                    <p>Below is a basic level flow-diagram that explains how the user interface components and 
                        development functions interact as the website is being used.</p>

                    <p>At the start of the pandemic, finding a COVID test was a difficult challenge. 
                        </p>
                        
                    <p class = "callout">Since the release of Find My COVID Test, I have been able to help more than 3,000 people find COVID-19 tests with an 
                        <b>average time of 34 seconds</b>.</p> 
            
                    <p>Prior to creating this website, past test recipients reported that the average time test was <b>16 minutes and 41 seconds</b>. 
                        Overall, my website has greatly reduced the search time for finding the most suitable COVID-19 test. 
                        With the improved accessibility, I hope to be able to increase the amount of California residents receiving tests, 
                        creating a healthier and aware community that can flatten the curve.</p>
            
                      <p>As I continue to add testing locations to the map, I am proactively reaching out to the California government and testing organizations such as Verily- Project Baseline, CVS Health, and Walgreens to work together and improve the website's map coverage across the United States.</p>
            
                      <p>Being the sole designer and developer of this project has been rewarding in itself to positively impact the community and make finding COVID testing more accessible to the public.</p>

                    <p>After many sleepless nights and 6 weeks later, I am so proud to release Find My COVID Test to the public.
                        This was definitely the most challenging design and development project that I have ever worked on.
                        It was a HUGE learning experience for myself and taught me much more than I could have ever imagined. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The biggest challenge I had while creating this website was imposter syndrome. There were many times
                        where I had encountered signficant development problems. However, I was determined to develop the 
                        website no matter what as I knew the true potential and how big of a difference I could create in 
                        the world once it was released.

                    <p>From January - March 2021, I continued working on Find My COVID Test to continue outreaching and updating the test location database.</p>
                    <p>At the end of my independent study, I was able to partner with 2 of the largest testing organizations in California, <a href = "https://www.projectbaseline.com/studies/covid-19/">
                    Verily- Project Baseline</a> and <a href = "https://curative.com/">Curative</a>. With their help,
                    Find My COVID Test now has <b>over 1,100 testing locations</b> to choose from!</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I was featured in an <a href = "https://lettersandscience.ucdavis.edu/blog/design-students-interactive-map-links-public-covid-19-testing-sites">article</a> by the University of California, Davis Letters and Sciences 
                    and the California Aggie newspaper!</p>
