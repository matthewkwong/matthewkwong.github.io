                <h2 class = "left">Overview</h2>
                <p class = "right">As an avid Spotify user, I noticed a problem that effected my music listening 
                    experience when driving with friends. In most cases, there's passengers arguing for the aux cord, 
                    who gets to queue music, and terrible song selection. As the driver, this can be extremely distracting and unsafe.

                <h2 class = "left">Research</h2>
                <div class = "right">
                    <p>To learn more about other peopleâ€™s experience listening to Spotify, I conducted 5 interviews with avid Spotify users ages 18-21. 
                        I chose to sample this age group because most college students listen to music through Spotify on a daily basis.
                    </p>
                   
                    <h3>Questions</h3>
                    <p>During the interviews, I asked participants questions regarding their experience using Spotify in group settings. 
                         For example, how do you typically listen to music with your friends? Do you make a collaborative playlist? Do you pass one phone to 
                         each person? Does one person control everything?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>After analyzing my interview notes, I found that most people disliked the music listening experience with their friends because it
                        takes too long to create a listening queue or there's an unequal distribution of music liking due to one person being in charge.

                    <p class = "callout"><i>Samantha is a 19 year old college student who considers herself to be 
                        an avid Spotify user. She typically listens to music with her friends in group settings- 
                        whether it's a party or in the car. She is typically the driver of her friend group and has 
                        trouble concentrating because her friends argue about who gets to choose the music. 
                        Samantha wishes that there was a better solution to improve this listening experience.</i>

                    <p>After thinking about the problems from my research, 
                        <strong>I concluded that the main problem was that only 
                            one person's music taste was being played.</strong></p>

                    <p> To solve this problem, I decided to make a prototype feature I would want introduced 
                        into the Spotify mobile application called Rooms. Rooms would allow Spotify users to 
                        collaboratively listen to music together with the abilities to add and vote to remove 
                        songs in listening parties. </p>

                     I created 2 paths of using Spotify Rooms, one for drivers and another for passengers.</p>

                <div class = "right">
                    <p>Once finalizing my high-fidelity wireframes, I imported the frames to Invision and created an interactive prototype.
                        While wiring my prototype, I made sure to have fluid transitions that were identical to that of Spotify's mobile app.  
                    </p>
                    <p>To use Spotify Rooms, there are 4 main components:</p>

                    <div class = "right">
                        <p>To create a new room, the host will press the Rooms tab on the main interface and 
                            click the "New Rooms" button. Similar to creating a new playlist, a pop-up will 
                            appear where they can name the newly created room. 
                            Once created, a 4 digit join code will be created, allowing members to join the room.

                        It was important to stay consistent to the real Spotify app to create the sense of realism.</p>

                    <p>During user testing, I found that 3/3 people between the ages of 18-21 felt that Spotify Rooms 
                        would improve collaborative listening in group settings.</p>

                    <p>However, I did find that some people would want alternative ways of joining a room. As a possibility, I 
                        tested a version using QR codes, but most users did not like that you would need to give camera access to 
                        the application.

                    <p>Building an entire user interface and experience was challenging for me.
                         Some design challenges I faced include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>How can I create the easiest way for users to join a Room?</li>
                        <li>How can the Rooms feature be safe for drivers?</li>
                        <li>How can I reach out and promote my product?</li>

                <div class = "right">
                    <p>I would like to explore more potential solutions ways of creating the Room lobby or 
                         ways of ensuring an evenly distributed number of songs selected between contributors.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I'm curious how the project would have been different if I had interviewed Apple Music or Tidal users
                        instead of focussing on creating a Spotify based experience?</p>
                
                    <p>Overall, this project was super motivating for me to increase my skills 
                        as a designer and to learn more about the UI/UX field. 
                        This was my first ever project focusing on the user interface 
                        and experience flow of an application. I am very happy with the 
                        work that I put in to this project and the solution I came up with to 
                        create a new way to share music at group events.</p>

                    <p>After building this project, I built an <a href="https://www.matthewkwong.com/spotify-rooms/">advertisement
                        website</a> showcasing and selling the idea.
                        Using this site, I reached out to 300+ Product Designers and
                        Product Managers at Spotify for feedback and to potentially receive an internship the
                        upcoming summer. Working at Spotify has been a dream
                        of mine since 2015 as a sophomore in high school. As weeks passed, I soon received
                        feedback from the Spotify employees I had asked for feedback from.

                    <p>In October 2019, I drove 2 hours to attend a Spotify internship recruitment panel
                        at the University of California, Berkeley. I had the opportunity to present and
                        demo my project with product managers at the company and pitch my idea and
                        prototype. This was a great learning experience and was a lot of fun getting feedback
                        and learning more about the company. </p>
