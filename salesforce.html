                    <p>To ensure this did not happen again, the new Salesforce Customer Success design system was revised to reduce confusion and maximize efficiency.</p>                
                    <p>Thus, we asked the question,</p>
                    <p class = "callout">
                        “How can we create a more effective design system that is up-to-date and easy to edit ?"

                    <div class = "right">
                        <p>To ensure we were creating the latest and greatest components in our new design system, I screen-captured every existing page type into Figma. This included multiple screen-captures of the different types of page styles if a user was logged-out, logged-in, or a signature/premier member and the entire user flow of registering for an event.</p>

                    <!-- Building Components-->
                    <h3 class = "left">Building Components</h3>
                    <div class = "right">
                        <p>Although some of the component designs had already been created and could be imported into our new system, many had lacked editability. 
                            For example, changing the text would require the designer to recreate the component entirely as it would overflow or incorrectly resize the component.
                        </p>

                        <p>To ensure this would not happen, I created efficient components utilizing a combination of Figma’s auto-layout, constraints, and variants features. Using these techniques helped create flexible components that were both easy to scale and change.</p>
                    </div>  

                    <!-- Cards -->

                        <p>
                            One of the key components that I built into our design system is the 4-column card
                            Within the component contains sub-components for icons such as the date/time on the top left and the heart on the right that can be swapped 
                            out through Figma variants.

                        <p>Additionally, it contains a variety of auto-layout and hug-contents settings that allow for fast text
                             revisions without breaking the component entirely as everything stays intact and grows accordingly, based on the changes you make. </p>

                        <p>A large component feature I worked on was the Events Registration Form. I created a flexible component that allows the data entries to be changed through Figma component variants.
