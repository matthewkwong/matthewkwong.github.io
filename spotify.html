                        When with his friends, he is the driver of his friend group and has trouble

                    <p> To solve this problem, I decided to make a prototype feature I would want introduced 
                        into the Spotify mobile application called Rooms. Rooms would allow Spotify users to 
                        collaboratively listen to music together with the abilities to add and vote to remove 
                        songs in listening parties. </p>

                        Given more screen real estate, I came up with the idea to have a filtering menu on the left side of the page to allow users to quickly and easily 
                        find a COVID testing center that met their personal needs.

                    <p >While creating Spotify Rooms, I kept in mind the pre-existing design guidelines that Spotify uses.
                        It was important to stay consistent to the real Spotify app to create the sense of realism.</p>

                    <p>Building an entire user interface and experience by yourself is
                        challenging. Some design challenges I faced include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>How can I create the easiest way for users to join a Room?</li>
                        <li>How can the Rooms feature be safe for drivers?</li>
                        <li>How can I reach out and promote my product?</li>

                    <p>This project was super motivating for me to increase my skills 
                        as a designer and to learn more about the UI/UX field. 
                        This was my first ever project focussing on the user interface 
                        and experience flow of an application. I am very happy with the 
                        work that I put in to this project and the solution I came up with to 
                        create a new way to share music at group events.</p>

                    <p>After building this project, I built an <a href="https://www.matthewkwong.com/spotify-rooms/">advertisement
                        website</a> showcasing and selling the idea.
                        Using this site, I reached out to 300+ Product Designers and
                        Product Managers at Spotify for feedback and to potentially receive an internship the
                        upcoming summer. Working at Spotify has been a dream
                        of mine since 2015 as a sophomore in high school. As weeks passed, I soon received
                        feedback from the Spotify employees I had asked for feedback from.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>In October 2019, I drove 2 hours to attend a Spotify internship recruitment panel
                        at the University of California, Berkeley. I had the opportunity to present and
                        demo my project with product managers at the company and pitch my idea and
                        prototype. This was a great learning experience and was a lot of fun getting feedback
                        and learning more about the company. </p>
